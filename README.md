This is my interpretation of what he builds in this class.

I chose to use Class-Based Generic Views, and the Django Forms module in my implementation.

I checked in the media directory, which normally you wouldn't do - but I didn't want to re-upload the data every time I moved between machines.

This project requires Python 3 - I used Python 3.7 and PyCharm.

I created Template Tags for the Listing Tile and Realtor tile to avoid having that HTML in multiple places throughout the app.

I renamed the 'btre' module to 'project', which is a standard I've seen elsewhere that makes it easier to find things across projects.
