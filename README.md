Udemy Django Dev to Deployment Class Project

This is my interpretation of what he builds in this class.

I chose to use Class-Based Generic Views, and the Django Forms module in my implementation.

I also checked in the media directory, which normally you wouldn't do - but I didn't want to re-upload the data every time I moved between machines.

This project requires Python 3 - I used Python 3.7 and PyCharm.

I also created Template Tags for the Listing Tile and Realtor tile to avoid having that HTML in multiple places throughout the app.
